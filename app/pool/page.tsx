              The Pool Division began as a small specialist team inside Seed Engineering, called on
              when MEP projects included aquatic features that no contractor in the city wanted to
              touch — vanishing edges, vitality pools, multi-temperature suites, integrated
              architectural water.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is now a full division. We design, build, renovate and maintain pools across
              hospitality, luxury residential, and architect-led private work. Every project is led
              by a senior partner. No project is templated.

                  General contractors treat pools as a shell, a pump and a finish. We treat them as
                  a balance of hydraulic flow, water chemistry, thermal control and architectural
                  intent — and we do not stop until all four are right.
