        'The reason most buildings in this region have an HVAC complaint log is not the equipment. It is the cooling load assumed at design stage, the lack of redundancy planned at procurement stage, and the commissioning that was rushed at handover stage. We fix all three.',
        'A chilled-water system in Dubai has to perform when ambient temperatures push 48°C. It has to operate when half the building is unoccupied for the summer. It has to recover quickly when a thousand people walk back into the lobby on a Sunday morning. The design assumptions matter.',
        'We design HVAC for the worst day, commission it for the most demanding floor, and hand it over with an air-balance report a tenant can read. The result: buildings where the thermostat is set once and not touched again.',
