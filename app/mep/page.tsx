              Most MEP consultants in this market sell a deliverable: a set of drawings, a schedule
              of works, a finished building. Seed Engineering sells a relationship with the systems
              themselves — from the first single-line diagram to the day a tenant moves out a
              decade later and the next one moves in to a building that still works.

            <p>
              We work with developers, architects, hospitality groups and private clients. We
              design, build, commission and maintain. We sign drawings we are willing to defend,
              and we walk job sites we are willing to put our name on.
