        'A commercial building is a stack of systems that all have to work together: cooling, ventilation, power distribution, lifts, fire safety, water supply, drainage, lighting, low-voltage, and increasingly a layer of building intelligence on top. The way a tower in DIFC is judged by tenants comes down to whether those systems behave invisibly.',
        'The brief we usually receive is a floor plan, a programme, and a tenancy mix. The work we do is everything that turns that into a building a major bank, a law firm, or a tech anchor is willing to move five hundred staff into and renew their lease at the end of the term.',
        'We coordinate with the architect from concept stage, sit inside the contractor team during construction, and stay through tenant fit-out — because the systems we drew need to survive the first twenty fit-outs that follow handover.',
