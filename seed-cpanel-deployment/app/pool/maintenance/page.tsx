        'A pool that has been well-maintained reads instantly: the water is clear, the surface is still, the smell of chlorine is absent, the tile lines are crisp at the waterline. A pool that has been neglected reads instantly too — and no amount of cleaning hides it.',
        'Our maintenance teams are not generic technicians. They are trained in water chemistry, hydraulic balance, surface protection and equipment service. Each contract has a named lead engineer and a measurable performance standard — not just a scheduled visit count.',
        'For hospitality clients, our service includes pre-season recommissioning, peak-season daily checks, and shoulder-season equipment review. For private clients, our service is built around how the pool is actually used — not a generic monthly visit.',
