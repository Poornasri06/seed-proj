        'A pool that has been in service for ten or fifteen years usually has three problems at once — a tired finish, a struggling plant room, and hydraulics that were never quite balanced in the first place. The temptation is to fix the visible problem and leave the rest. We do the opposite.',
        'Every renovation begins with a thorough survey: shell condition, waterproofing integrity, plant room performance, hydraulic balance, chemistry control, and architectural intent. The report you receive is honest about what is still good and what is past its life.',
        'We deliver renovations in phases that allow the asset to remain in operation — critical for hotel projects where closing a pool for a season is not an option. Plant is swapped, finishes refreshed, hydraulics re-engineered, and the pool is back in service to a standard above where it started.',
